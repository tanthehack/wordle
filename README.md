# Wordle Clone in Terminal Using Colorama

A horrible wordle clone using [Colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/), a Python module commonly used to 'color-ify' thy terminal.<br>

## Description
A simple wordle clone in terminal using the python module [Colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/). 

Wordle is a web-based word game created and developed by Welsh software engineer Josh Wardle, and owned and published by The New York Times Company since 2022.

## How to Play Wordle
Guess the mystery 5 letter word!
After each guess, the letters will change color to show how close you were to the correct word:

* Red - the letter is not in the word
* Yellow - the letter is in the word but in the wrong place
* Green - the letter is in the word but in the wrong place

Once all the letters are green, you've won! But if you don't guess the word in six tries, you've lost :(

## From Tanya to You ;) -->
Hope you enjoy my wordle clone! Worked hard on it :) 
I will in the future try to implement:

* Double Letters in the Guessed Word Bug Fix
* Guessed Words List
* GUI to play the game
